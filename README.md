# Health Care Management System Using NoSQL

Welcome to the Health Care Management System Using NoSQL project! üè•

This project focuses on the management and analysis of healthcare data using NoSQL databases. A healthcare dataset was prepared and analyzed to obtain performance insights into various NoSQL databases deployed on AWS. Specifically, a Spark cluster was utilized to run the MongoDB and Cassandra shells on the AWS infrastructure.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of different NoSQL databases in handling healthcare data. By leveraging a real-world healthcare dataset, we aim to assess the suitability of MongoDB and Cassandra databases for healthcare management systems, particularly in terms of scalability, reliability, and query performance.

## Dataset

The healthcare dataset used in this project comprises anonymized patient records, medical diagnoses, treatment histories, and other relevant healthcare information. The dataset was carefully prepared to simulate real-world scenarios and ensure comprehensive analysis across various dimensions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: The healthcare dataset was preprocessed and cleaned to ensure consistency and integrity.
  
2. **NoSQL Database Deployment**: MongoDB and Cassandra databases were deployed on the AWS infrastructure, leveraging the scalability and flexibility of cloud computing.

3. **Performance Analysis**: The prepared dataset was loaded into both MongoDB and Cassandra databases. Performance metrics such as query execution time, throughput, and scalability were measured and analyzed.

4. **Comparison and Evaluation**: The performance of MongoDB and Cassandra databases was compared based on the obtained results. Insights were drawn to evaluate the suitability of each database for healthcare management systems.

## Technologies Used

- **NoSQL Databases**:
  - MongoDB: A document-oriented database for high flexibility and scalability.
  - Cassandra: A distributed database known for its high availability and fault tolerance.

- **AWS Services**:
  - Amazon EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud for scalable virtual servers.
  - Amazon EMR: Elastic MapReduce for processing large datasets using Spark.

- **Apache Spark**: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.

## Results and Analysis

The performance analysis revealed valuable insights into the capabilities of MongoDB and Cassandra databases in handling healthcare data. Key findings, including query latency, throughput, and scalability, were documented to guide decision-making in database selection for healthcare management systems.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive evaluation of MongoDB and Cassandra databases in the context of healthcare management systems. By leveraging real-world healthcare data and cloud-based infrastructure, we gain valuable insights into the performance characteristics and suitability of NoSQL databases for healthcare applications.
